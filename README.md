## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+

## Usage
Use MBProgressHUD to set up on the main thread and then switch the task to be performed to the new thread.

````
let hud = LPProgressHUD.show(to: view, animated: true)
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    // Do something...
    DispatchQueue.main.sync {
        hud.hide(animated: true)
    }
}
````
